            <b>Site Description:</b> (Jan, 2024)
        This website is created and maintained personally by research scholar Dongmei Zuo as a repository 
        for her Chinese scholarly work. Due to a paywall in many Chinese academic source hosting services, 
        many of her her Chinese research publications have been hid behind a paywall; failed to be
        included on the American internet and unavailable to the American audience.
        This site lists her past works and links to full pdf for her past publications.
